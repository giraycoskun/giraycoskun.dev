# Starting A Python Project

Most of my projects either entirely Python or includes a python library as it is my favorite  programming language.

Essentials of a project:
    - Dependency Management
    - Logging
    - Documentation

## Dependency Management

First of all I am a fan of [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in Python. So that is a must for me during development at least.

## Logging

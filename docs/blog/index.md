# May the Force be with your software

I am Giray Coskun. A software engineer graduated from Sabanci University, Computer Science and Engineering.

This blogs are going to be both personal and software related. I have also another writing section that I frequently use myself so that is more like a notebook.

[:notebook: Developer's Notebook](../developers-notebook/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

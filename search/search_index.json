We also develop a number of CIT-daily strategies and empirically evaluate them on highly-configurable systems. The first strategy tests the same t-way covering array every day throughout the process, achieving a t-way coverage on a daily basis by covering each possible combination of option settings for every combination of options. The other strategies, on the other hand, while guaranteeing a t-way coverage on a daily basis, aim to cover higher order interactions between the configuration options over time by varying the t-way covering arrays tested. In the experiments, we observed that the proposed approach significantly improved the effectiveness (i.e., fault revealing abilities) of the daily build processes; randomizing the coverage of higher order interactions between the configuration options while guaranteeing a base t-way coverage every day, further improved the effectiveness; and the more the higher order interactions covered during the process, the higher the fault revealing abilities tended to be.

The first strategy tests the same t-way covering array every day throughout the process, achieving a t-way coverage on a daily basis by covering each possible combination of option settings for every combination of options. The other strategies, on the other hand, while guaranteeing a t-way coverage on a daily basis, aim to cover higher order interactions between the configuration options over time by varying the t-way covering arrays tested. In the experiments, we observed that the proposed approach significantly improved the effectiveness (i.e., fault revealing abilities) of the daily build processes; randomizing the coverage of higher order interactions between the configuration options while guaranteeing a base t-way coverage every day, further improved the effectiveness; and the more the higher order interactions covered during the process, the higher the fault revealing abilities tended to be.","title":"CIT-daily: A combinatorial interaction testing-based daily build process"},{"location":"home/projects/#using-unified-combinatorial-interaction-testing-for-mcdc-coverage","text":"ICST (IWCT Workshop) 2022 IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops (ICSTW) 11th International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing Authors: Giray Coskun, Cankut Coskun, Hanefi Mercan, Cemal Yilmaz Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9787934 Conference: https://icst2022.vrain.upv.es/details/iwct-2022-papers/3/Using-Unified-Combinatorial-Interaction-Testing-for-MC-DC-Coverage","title":"Using Unified Combinatorial Interaction Testing for MC/DC Coverage"},{"location":"home/projects/#unsupervised-adaptation-of-dnn-for-brain-computer-interface-spellers","text":"SIU 2022 30th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU) Authors: Osman Berke G\u00fcney, Deniz K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckahmetler, Pelinsu \u00c7ift\u00e7io\u011flu, Giray Co\u015fkun, H\u00fcseyin \u00d6zkan Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9864700","title":"Unsupervised Adaptation of DNN for Brain-Computer Interface Spellers"},{"location":"home/projects/#projects","text":"","title":"Projects"},{"location":"home/projects/#research-projects","text":"","title":"Research Projects"},{"location":"home/projects/#using-unified-combinatorial-interaction-testing-for-mcdc-coverage_1","text":"","title":"Using Unified Combinatorial Interaction Testing for MC/DC Coverage"},{"location":"home/projects/#a-combinatorial-interaction-testing-based-daily-build-process","text":"","title":"A Combinatorial Interaction Testing-Based Daily Build Process"},{"location":"home/projects/#unsupervised-ssvep-signal-classification","text":"","title":"Unsupervised SSVEP Signal Classification"},{"location":"home/projects/#kanade-russells-identity-finder","text":"","title":"KANADE RUSSELL\u2019S Identity Finder"},{"location":"home/projects/#side-projects","text":"","title":"Side Projects"},{"location":"home/projects/#university-anouncement-system-mysu-anouncement-delivery","text":"Github: https://github.com/giraycoskun/University-Anouncement-System","title":"University Anouncement System (MySU Anouncement Delivery)"},{"location":"home/projects/#school-projects","text":"","title":"School Projects"},{"location":"home/projects/#encryption-in-assembly","text":"Github: https://github.com/giraycoskun/encrption-in-assembly Keywords: assembly, cryptographic algorithm","title":"Encryption in Assembly"},{"location":"home/projects/#client-server-drive-app","text":"Github: https://github.com/giraycoskun/Client-Server-Drive-App Keywords: socket programming, network, client-server architecture, C#","title":"Client-Server-Drive-App"},{"location":"home/skills/","text":"","title":"Skills"},{"location":"projects/","text":"Projects","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#projects","text":"","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/course-projects/","text":"Course Projects","title":"Coursework Projects"},{"location":"projects/course-projects/#course-projects","text":"","title":"Course Projects"},{"location":"projects/research-projects/","text":"Research Project","title":"Research Projects"},{"location":"projects/research-projects/#research-project","text":"","title":"Research Project"},{"location":"projects/side-projects/","text":"Side Projects","title":"Side Projects"},{"location":"projects/side-projects/#side-projects","text":"","title":"Side Projects"}]}
